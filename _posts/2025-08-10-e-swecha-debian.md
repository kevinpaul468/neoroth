## Debian 13 "Trixie" Released — And e-Swecha Joins the Party!

The **Debian Project** has officially announced the release of **Debian 13 “Trixie”** yesterday, bringing with it a massive set of updates, improved hardware support, and more than **13,000 new packages**. It comes with live boot and installation support, and works across various architectures — keeping Debian’s legacy of universality intact.

Today, the excitement continues with the release of **e-Swecha**, a **FOSS** (Free and Open Source Software) operating system **built on top of Debian 13 “Trixie”**.

## What is e-Swecha?

**e-Swecha** is a specialized Debian-based distribution, **designed for coding and development purposes**. While Debian provides a robust and stable base, e-Swecha takes it a step further by including a **preinstalled development stack**. This means developers can start working right after installation — no tedious setup required.

### Key Highlights of e-Swecha

- **Built on Debian 13 “Trixie”**
- **Linux Kernel 6.12 LTS** for improved hardware support and stability
- **Preinstalled development stack**, including **VSCodium** for coding out-of-the-box
- Designed for ** engineering students**
- Recommended os for summer of ai interns at Vishwam.ai
- Supports **HTTP Boot** and **PXE Boot** for network-based deployments
- Ideal for both **live boot** sessions and full installation
- Fully compatible with Debian’s **13,000+ new packages**

## Why e-Swecha?

The main goal behind e-Swecha is to **offer a developer-focused Linux experience** that works right from the start. While many distros are general-purpose, e-Swecha is tailored for **programmers, DevOps engineers, and AI/ML enthusiasts**, ensuring essential tools are available without extra configuration.

With **Debian’s legendary stability** and **modern kernel support**, e-Swecha is an excellent choice for both seasoned developers and students who want a ready-to-code environment.
